          You have been invited to take part in a research study about human
          reasoning. This study will be conducted by Dylan Bumford as a
          part of his PhD research in linguistics. His faculty sponsor is
          Professor Frans Adriaans, Department of Linguistics, New York University. 
          </p>
          <p>
          If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following: 

          <ul>
            <li>View a number of sentences in an artificial language, invented
            by the researcher.</li>
            <li>Predict some of the words before they are revealed to
            you.</li>
            <li>Provide basic demographic information (languages spoken,
            gender, and age).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          Participation in this study will take approximately 45 minutes.  You
          will be paid USD $5.00 (five US dollars) for your participation,
          even if you withdraw before the end of the task. 
          </p>
          <p>
          There are no known risks associated with your participation in this
          research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no
          direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand
          how grammars are acquired. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained
          by guaranteeing that your participation is entirely anonymous.
          Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to
          participate or withdraw at anytime without penalty.
          </p> 
          <p>
          If there is anything about the study or your participation that is
          unclear or that you do not understand, or if you have questions or

          Bumford at dtb260@nyu.edu, or the faculty sponsor, Frans Adriaans, at
